This is a stopwatch which I have made by watching some tutorials and adding my own logics too.
The ui and design is done completely by me although I have taken the help of the uiverse.io for the buttons as thor animation looks amazing.
This stopwatch is fully functional and higly accurate.
There were some of the key learnings in making of this small project which I have mentioned in the important pointes file attached to this project.
Thank you for visiting !!
